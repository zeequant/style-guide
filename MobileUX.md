Guidelines for Mobile Design:
- Easy to click icons using thumb.
- Partial Pages should have back button in the header at the top of the screen.
- Do not try to show all the information (available in the web view) in the mobile view. 
- Consistent Layout for all pages.
- Lsit View should feelk like a mobile list, not like a web application.
- Highlight important content. (Not important content should not grab the eye balls.)
- Have a consistent layout for all pages. (header/subheader/content/tabs/navBtns)
- No keyboard/screen jumping when trying to type anything.
- Native input boxes/select boxes. Fancy js input items are not advised.
- On pressing mobile back button, it should properly go to previous pages. (Use history.replace state, so that minor ui changes do not interfere with browser back button stack)
- Consistent Modal boxes.
- Consistent inline edits.
- No inline edits in List view.

Debatable Items:
- Mobile header what all to have.
